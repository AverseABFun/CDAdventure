# CDAdventure

Put a choose-your-own-adventure on a CD! Also, a warning: Don't play trench_journey. It is incredibly boring. I don't know why I made it like that. Also, there are weird spelling errors.

WARNING FOR WRITERS: Version 1.3-1.32 are the versions you can use. Check the documentation for information, or make an issue if you still have a question.

Update: You *should* be able to run `npx @averse/cdadventure` with the arguments to compile a game. As it wasn't built for that, you need to make a games folder and have games in there, which I will be fixing soon.
